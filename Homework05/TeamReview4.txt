The end result fo the product was good. They really cleaned up the navigation from page to page, also i like that they added my recommendation
making the picture swipable. Over all, the app looks good and i like how it turned out. My only criticism is the entry boxes, they just look out
of place due to the shading, i think it would of looked better if they made it transparent.
