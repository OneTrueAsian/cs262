Over all, the prototype for the app was pretty good compared to the last time i saw it. The last time i saw their app, it was very
cramped and messy. They had all their buttons on one screen, they did not organize it any way and the quiz was not up and running. In today's
demo and the user test they had all the button on correct screen, they got the questionare up and it looked like a proficient app. One
complaint i had was that they did not have the swipping mechanism working, but over all the app looks good.
