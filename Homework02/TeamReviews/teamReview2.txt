Does their Trello board show the appropriate amount of activity?
 - Yes it does, 59 hours for sprint 2 was done over their estimate of 55.36. Looks like they underestmate their time.

Write a one-to-two-paragraph review of their models. Are their user stories, class model and UI model well-formulated? Do they describe a coherent system?
 - over all, all their diagrams are pretty good. The flow is easy to follow and it provides a lot of good information. My only complaint is their use case diagram
was in pencil, which made it harder to read, but over all the two diagrams were really good, except the UI diagram. The UI diagram when compared to the proto-
type looks a bit rocky, the prototype looks somewhat far from the UI Diagram, but i do understand that it's not the final product. Over all, i had very
little complaints. 

Has there been an appropriate amount of code pushed into their client repo? Can you run the prototype? If so, does the application make sense to you?
 - There's a decent amount of activity in the gitHub, but nto alot. Over the past month there has been 18 merges and 4 pull requests, which i feel like it's a
little for the amount of work they've done. Aside the lack of merge and pulls, i was able to run the app and it was pretty easy to learn. 

Does their supplemental specification address non-functional requirements? Are they missing anything important?
 - No, i could nto find any files for the NFR or supplimental specifications on their client repo or trello.
